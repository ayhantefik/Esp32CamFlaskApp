<h1>Real-Time Video Streaming and Recognition System</h1>

This project showcases a real-time video streaming and AI-powered recognition system utilizing an ESP32-CAM module. The camera module captures live video and streams it through a custom socket server, which relays the feed to a Flask web application for further processing. The Flask backend performs object detection and text recognition on the incoming video frames.
